Welcome to the Amazon Clone project! This is a simplified version of the Amazon website, built entirely using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
This project aims to demonstrate the power of pure JavaScript in creating dynamic, responsive web applications without relying on libraries or frameworks.
